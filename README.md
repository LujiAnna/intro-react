- be able to "think in React"
- be able to use basic hooks for managing state and reactivity

- [x] Read this [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)
- [x] Create a React application and run it locally on your browser (hint-hint: start here)

When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder. You can learn more about Create React App from its README and the User Guide.

- [x] Publish the source code on your GitHub repository
- [ ] Build a Todo App with React.js (Check out this useful instructions ) . CRUD
- [ ] Save your todo's, even after starting the browser again
- [ ] Deploy the project on a live server Tip if you choose Netlify: to deploy a React app you first run the command npm run build, and once the command finishes you will have your app ready in the build folder: just drag and drop this folder in Netlify and you are done. Easy!
ðŸŒ¼ Nice-to-have (doable)
Refactor parts you aren't happy with.
Rebuild from scratch without any tutorial to improve your understanding (Instructions will be of a big help here!).
Improve on your project so that it's not only a learning repository, but also a show off project when interviewing:
Add styling
Improve responsiveness
Check for little, smooth effects
Think UX: what extra features can make your todo app better?
ðŸŒ³ Nice-to-have (hard)
Install a react package of a calendar and implement it in a new component into your App.
Install and use React-router-dom as a router between components. (Hint: Think about a structure like: router -> show component)
Have a live edit option for existing todo's (when you click on the text of a todo, the app allows you to edit it in place).
Make a version with another JS framework like VueJS or Svelte.
