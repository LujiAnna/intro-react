# intro-react

build a small Todo application that lives in your browser, and saves todos even after restarting the browser.

- be able to create a new React application
- be able to "think in React"
- be able to use basic hooks for managing state and reactivity
- be able to organize your app in components


ðŸŒ± Must-have's
- Publish the source code on your GitHub repository
- Build a Todo App with React.js (Check out this useful instructions )
- Save your todo's, even after starting the browser again
- Deploy the project on a live server Tip if you choose Netlify: to deploy a React app you first run the command npm run build, and once the command finishes you will have your app ready in the build folder: just drag and drop this folder in Netlify and you are done. Easy!

ðŸŒ¼ Nice-to-have (doable)
- [x] Refactor. 
     - [x] use ES6 arrow functions
     - [ ] use map, filter, reduce, 
     - [ ] [tutorials](https://github.com/becodeorg/gnt-verou-2/tree/main/3.The-Mountain/12.React/2.Extra-Documentation)
- [x] Add styling
- [x] Improve responsiveness
- [ ] Check for little, smooth effects
- [ ] Think UX: what extra features can make your todo app better?


ðŸŒ³ Nice-to-have (hard)
- [ ] Install a react package of a calendar and implement it in a new component into your App.
- [ ] Install and use React-router-dom as a router between components. (Hint: Think about a structure like: router -> show component)
- [ ] Have a live edit option for existing todo's (when you click on the text of a todo, the app allows you to edit it in place).
- [ ] Make a version with another JS framework like VueJS or Svelte.
